# AI Prompt for Generating LexiAid Application Flowchart

## Overview
You are tasked with creating a comprehensive visual flowchart for LexiAid, a legal education platform designed specifically for law students. The application integrates AI-powered legal research, case analysis, and academic management tools.

## Primary Flowchart Requirements

### Main User Flow (Top-Level)
Create a flowchart starting with:
- **Entry Point**: "Law Student User" (styled with light blue background #e1f5fe)
- **Central Hub**: "LexiAid Dashboard" (styled with light purple background #f3e5f5)

From the dashboard, create 5 main branches leading to:
1. **Semantic Search** (green background #e8f5e8)
2. **Task Management** (orange background #fff3e0)  
3. **Study Insights** (pink background #fce4ec)
4. **Case Brief Generator** (teal background #e0f2f1)
5. **Quizzes & Learning** (light green background #f1f8e9)

### Detailed Sub-Flows

#### 1. Semantic Search Flow
Create a detailed sub-flow showing:
- Enter Legal Query → AI Processing with NLP → Decision Diamond "Semantic Match Found?"
- If Yes: Display Relevant Cases → Auto-Tag Legal Categories → Store in Personal Library
- If No: Fallback Keyword Search → Display Relevant Cases → Auto-Tag Legal Categories → Store in Personal Library

#### 2. Task Management Flow
Show progression:
- Add Academic Tasks → Priority Ranking System → Due Date Analysis → Task Dashboard Display → Progress Tracking

#### 3. Study Insights Flow
Display sequence:
- Track Study Time → Quiz Performance Analysis → Generate Charts & Metrics → Personalized Recommendations → Weak Area Identification

#### 4. Case Brief Generator Flow
Illustrate process:
- Upload Legal Case Document → AI Text Analysis → Extract Key Components → Generate Structured Brief → Facts | Issues | Holdings | Reasoning → Save to Library

#### 5. Quiz System Flow
Show learning cycle:
- Select Topic/Category → Generate Quiz Questions → Interactive Assessment → Immediate Feedback → Performance Analytics → (connects back to Quiz Performance Analysis in Study Insights)

### Data Storage Integration
Create two main database nodes:
- **Legal Documents Database** (yellow background #fff8e1) - receives data from Semantic Search and Case Brief Generator
- **User Progress Database** (yellow background #fff8e1) - receives data from Task Management, Study Insights, and Quiz System

### Technical Backend Infrastructure
Add technical components:
- **MySQL Database** (light red background #ffebee) - connected to both database nodes
- **Python NLP Engine** (light blue background #e3f2fd) - connected to AI Processing and Text Analysis
- **Hugging Face Transformers** - connected to Python NLP Engine
- **Sentence Transformers** - connected to Python NLP Engine

### Frontend Technology Stack
Include frontend components:
- **Web Interface** connected to Dashboard
- **HTML5/CSS3/JavaScript** connected to Web Interface
- **Bootstrap Framework** connected to Web Interface
- **Chart.js Visualizations** connected to Web Interface

### API Layer
Add backend API component:
- **PHP Backend APIs** - connects Web Interface to MySQL Database and Python NLP Engine

## Visual Design Guidelines

### Color Scheme
- User/Entry Points: Light Blue (#e1f5fe)
- Main Dashboard: Light Purple (#f3e5f5)
- Semantic Search: Green (#e8f5e8)
- Task Management: Orange (#fff3e0)
- Study Insights: Pink (#fce4ec)
- Case Brief Generator: Teal (#e0f2f1)
- Quizzes & Learning: Light Green (#f1f8e9)
- Databases: Yellow (#fff8e1)
- MySQL: Light Red (#ffebee)
- Python/AI Components: Light Blue (#e3f2fd)

### Flow Direction
- Use top-down hierarchy starting from the user
- Show clear decision points with diamond shapes
- Use arrows to indicate data flow and process direction
- Group related components logically

### Node Types
- Rectangular nodes for processes and components
- Diamond shapes for decision points
- Rounded rectangles for user interfaces
- Cylindrical shapes for databases

## System Architecture Diagram Requirements

Create a secondary diagram showing:

### Frontend Layer
- Dashboard UI, Search Interface, Task Manager UI, Analytics Dashboard, Quiz Interface

### API Layer  
- PHP Controllers, Authentication, Session Management, Error Handling

### AI/NLP Engine
- Semantic Search, Case Brief Generator, Auto-Tagging, Content Analysis

### Data Layer
- MySQL Database, Legal Documents JSON, User Profiles, Study Analytics

Show connections between layers with clear directional arrows indicating data flow and API calls.

## Key Relationships to Emphasize

1. **User-Centric Design**: All flows originate from and return value to the law student user
2. **AI Integration**: Highlight how AI/NLP components enhance traditional legal research
3. **Data Persistence**: Show how user actions and AI processing results are stored for future use
4. **Cross-Feature Integration**: Demonstrate how quiz performance feeds into study insights
5. **Scalable Architecture**: Illustrate separation of concerns between frontend, API, AI, and data layers

## Technical Implementation Notes

- Use Mermaid.js syntax for web-based rendering
- Ensure flowchart is readable at multiple zoom levels
- Include clear labels for all nodes and connections
- Use consistent arrow styles and node shapes
- Optimize for both technical and non-technical audiences

## Success Criteria

The generated flowchart should:
1. Clearly communicate the complete user journey through LexiAid
2. Show technical architecture without overwhelming non-technical viewers
3. Demonstrate the AI-enhanced nature of legal research and study tools
4. Illustrate data flow and system integration points
5. Serve as both user documentation and technical reference

This flowchart will serve as the primary visual documentation for LexiAid's functionality and technical architecture, helping stakeholders understand both user experience and system design.
